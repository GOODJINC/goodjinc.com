## 👋 About Me

Hello, I am **GOODJINC**.

I am an emerging developer who discovered the world of IT later than most, yet I am finding endless possibilities within the journey of continuous learning. My goal is to move forward step-by-step to create software that provides practical value to people's lives.

- **Family First 👨‍👩‍👧**: My family—my wife and daughter—is the core of my life. I dream of building a warm home where we all grow together.

- **Sharing Knowledge 💻**: I record what I learn and experience, hoping that my archives can be of small help to someone else.

- **Goal**: I aspire to become a software developer who brings positive changes to everyday life.

## ✨ My Bio: From You, the 1%

> _Do not fear being the first to laugh, the first to sing, the first to rise, and the first to love._

The bio of this blog, **"From You, the 1%"**, is inspired by a poem by author Kim Eun-ju.

Among a hundred expressionless faces, I hope to be the one who smiles; when everyone else is silent, I hope to be the one who sings. I wish for my records to provide the "second" and "third" courage to someone else who needs it.
